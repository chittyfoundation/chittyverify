# ChittyID Trust-Based Verification System

## ChittyID Trust Levels (L0-L4)

### Level 0: Anonymous (Trust Weight: 0.1)
- No verified identity
- Minimal verification power
- Can only add supporting evidence

### Level 1: Basic Verified (Trust Weight: 0.3)

- Basic KYC complete
- Can verify non-critical documents

### Level 2: Enhanced Verified (Trust Weight: 0.5)
- Government ID verified
- Address verification
- Background check passed
- Can verify standard legal documents

### Level 3: Professional Verified (Trust Weight: 0.8)
- Professional license verified (attorney, notary, etc.)
- Business entity verification
- Insurance/bonding verified
- Can verify high-stakes documents

### Level 4: Institutional (Trust Weight: 1.0)
- Government agencies
- Courts
- Financial institutions
- Maximum verification authority

## Weighted Verification Formula

```
FINAL_TRUST_SCORE = Σ(verifier_trust_level × role_weight × verification_quality)
```

### Example: Fox Lease Verification

```javascript
const verifications = [
  {
    verifier: "Landlord_ChittyID",
    chittyLevel: 2,        // Enhanced verified
    trustWeight: 0.5,      // L2 weight
    role: "SUBMITTER",
    roleWeight: 0.25,      // Submitter role weight
    quality: 1.0           // Full verification
  },
  {
    verifier: "Attorney_ChittyID",
    chittyLevel: 3,        // Professional verified
    trustWeight: 0.8,      // L3 weight
    role: "LEGAL_COUNSEL",
    roleWeight: 0.40,      // Attorney role weight
    quality: 1.0           // Full legal review
  },
  {
    verifier: "ProcessServer_ChittyID",
    chittyLevel: 2,        // Enhanced verified
    trustWeight: 0.5,      // L2 weight
    role: "WITNESS",
    roleWeight: 0.20,      // Witness role weight
    quality: 1.0           // Confirmed service
  }
];

// Calculate combined trust score
let totalScore = 0;
verifications.forEach(v => {
  totalScore += (v.trustWeight * v.roleWeight * v.quality);
});

// Result: 0.125 + 0.32 + 0.10 = 0.545 (54.5% trust)
```

## Smart Contract Integration

```solidity
contract ChittyIDVerification {
    struct ChittyID {
        address wallet;
        uint8 trustLevel;    // 0-4
        uint256 trustScore;  // 0-1000 (3 decimals)
        uint256 verificationCount;
        uint256 disputeCount;
        mapping(string => bool) credentials;
    }
    
    struct EvidenceVerification {
        bytes32 evidenceHash;
        address verifier;
        uint8 verifierTrustLevel;
        uint256 verifierTrustScore;
        VerificationRole role;
        uint256 timestamp;
        string attestation;
        uint8 confidence;    // 0-100%
    }
    
    function calculateEvidenceTrust(bytes32 evidenceHash) 
        public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 totalTrust = 0;
        uint256 totalWeight = 0;
        
        for (uint i = 0; i < verifications[evidenceHash].length; i++) {
            Verification memory v = verifications[evidenceHash][i];
            ChittyID memory verifier = chittyIDs[v.verifier];
            
            uint256 weight = getVerifierWeight(
                verifier.trustLevel,
                verifier.trustScore,
                v.role
            );
            
            totalTrust += weight * v.confidence;
            totalWeight += weight;
        }
        
        return totalWeight > 0 ? totalTrust / totalWeight : 0;
    }
}
```

## Verification Marketplace

### Incentive Structure
- **Verifiers earn**: CHITTY tokens based on trust level
- **False verifications**: Slash staked tokens & reduce trust
- **Accurate verifications**: Increase trust score
