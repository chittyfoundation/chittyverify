# ChittyOS Trust Engine

> Making power structures visible, justice measurable, and business processes antifragile.

## Overview

The ChittyOS Trust Engine implements a revolutionary 6-dimensional trust scoring system that evaluates entities (people, organizations, AI agents) based on verifiable actions and outcomes rather than traditional credit metrics.

## 6D Trust Dimensions

1. **Source (Who)**: Identity verification and credential assessment
2. **Temporal (When)**: Time-based analysis and behavioral consistency
3. **Channel (How)**: Communication and transaction channel trust levels
4. **Outcome (Results)**: Track record of positive/negative outcomes
5. **Network (Connections)**: Quality and trust level of network connections
6. **Justice (Impact)**: Alignment with justice principles and societal benefit

## Output Scores

The engine produces four distinct scores, each optimized for different stakeholders:

- **People's Score**: Community impact and social trust (emphasizes network & justice)
- **Legal Score**: Technical compliance and legal standing (emphasizes verification)
- **State Score**: Authority approval and institutional trust (emphasizes credentials)
- **Chitty Score™**: Justice + outcomes - the true measure of trustworthiness

## Installation

```bash
pip install chitty-trust
```

## Quick Start

```python
from chitty_trust import calculate_trust, TrustEntity, TrustEvent
from datetime import datetime

# Create an entity
entity = TrustEntity(
    id="user_123",
    entity_type="person",
    name="Jane Doe",
    created_at=datetime.utcnow(),
    identity_verified=True
)

# Add trust events
events = [
    TrustEvent(
        id="evt_1",
        entity_id="user_123",
        event_type="transaction",
        timestamp=datetime.utcnow(),
        channel="blockchain",
        outcome="positive",
        impact_score=7.5,
        tags=["community_impact", "transparency"]
    ),
    # ... more events
]

# Calculate trust score
trust_score = await calculate_trust(entity, events)

print(f"Chitty Score: {trust_score.chitty_score}")
print(f"Composite Score: {trust_score.composite_score}")
print(f"Explanation: {trust_score.explanation}")
```

## API Usage

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from chitty_trust import TrustEngine

app = FastAPI()
engine = TrustEngine()

@app.post("/trust/calculate")
async def calculate_trust_score(entity_id: str):
    # Load entity and events from database
    entity = await load_entity(entity_id)
    events = await load_events(entity_id)
    
    # Calculate trust
    score = await engine.calculate_trust(entity, events)
    
    return score.to_dict()
```

## Advanced Features

### Custom Dimension Weights

```python
engine = TrustEngine()
engine.set_weights({
    "source": 0.2,
    "temporal": 0.1,
    "channel": 0.1,
    "outcome": 0.2,
    "network": 0.1,
    "justice": 0.3
})
```

### Event Tags for Justice Scoring

Events can be tagged to influence justice dimension scoring:

- `community_impact`: Positive community contribution
- `justice`: Justice-aligned action
- `transparency`: Transparent behavior
- `harm_prevention`: Prevented harm
- `transformation`: "Shitty to Chitty" transformation

### Easter Egg: Shitty to Chitty™

The Chitty Score includes a special transformation bonus for entities that demonstrate significant positive change over time. Tag transformation events with `"transformation"` to activate this feature.

## Philosophy

Traditional credit scores measure your ability to repay debt. The ChittyOS Trust Engine measures your positive impact on the world. By making trust calculations transparent and justice-weighted, we enable a new economy based on verified outcomes rather than institutional gatekeeping.
